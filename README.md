### FIRST SETUP of PROJECT

1. Make sure you have downloaded the latest LTS version of Unity. This should be **2021.3.25f1**. If you have another version installed, install this version instead.
  
  > **Note**
> You can check what version you have installed by clicking on the "Installs" tab on the left sidebar of Unity Hub. Then when you click "Install Editor", that version should appear.
          When the install dialogue comes up, make sure to click the checkbox for "Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)".

2. Once this is all done, open up either your systems terminal, or the Git terminal to whatever folder you want the project to sit inside of, and continue.

3. Use "git clone https://github.com/Hydralyph/twiknight.git" to grab the repo for first use. ***MAKE SURE TO HAVE YOUR TERMINAL IN THE FOLDER YOU WISH THE REPO TO BE CLONED TO.***

> **Warning**
> Before proceeding, you will have to change directories to jump inside of the "twiknight" folder that was cloned. You can do this either by using the same terminal and the cd command, or by opening a terminal in the "twiknight" folder.

4. Type "git checkout BRANCH_NAME", where BRANCH_NAME is your first name in lowercase. *You can check the branches on Github to ensure the branch you are using is correctly named.*

5. Type "git pull origin BRANCH_NAME", where BRANCH_NAME is the same as before. This should update the local repo if anything has changed (which it shouldn't have).

6. Open Unity Hub, and click on the down arrow next to the open button. Then click "Add Project from Disk".

5. Find the project folder, and open it.

6. The project should now be added to Unity. ***It will likely take some time on first open to load the project, as it has to generate some files the .gitignore... ignores.***

7. Profit?
